# 👋 Hey, I'm Ali Tavakoli (iLiYa)

Welcome to my digital workshop! I'm a **Full Stack Developer** who loves building powerful, responsive, and user-focused applications with **Angular**, **.NET Core**, and **MongoDB**. Whether it's creating sleek UIs or rock-solid backends, I'm here to craft experiences that leave a mark.

## 💼 My Toolbelt

When it comes to development, I believe in choosing the right tools for the job. Here’s a look at my go-to technologies for building scalable, high-performance applications:

### 🎨 Front-End Magic
- **Angular**: The framework that makes my UIs pop! With Angular, I bring interactivity, flexibility, and speed to the front-end. It’s my tool of choice for crafting complex, user-friendly applications.
- **TypeScript**: Bringing structure to JavaScript. TypeScript keeps my code clean, maintainable, and reliable — it’s like a safety net for every line I write.
- **JavaScript**: The classic, essential powerhouse behind modern web development, making sure my interfaces are as dynamic as they are beautiful.

### ⚙️ Back-End Powerhouse
- **.NET Core**: The backbone of my server-side development. With .NET Core, I build APIs and services that are fast, secure, and scalable.
- **C#**: My language of choice for creating robust, efficient backend logic. When paired with .NET Core, it’s a match made for high-performance applications.
- **MongoDB**: My go-to for flexible and scalable database solutions. MongoDB handles large datasets and keeps performance smooth, even when things get complex.

With this toolbelt, I'm ready to build applications that are not only technically sound but also a joy to use.
