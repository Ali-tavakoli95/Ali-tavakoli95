## ⚙️ My Tech Stack: Crafting Digital Experiences

Here’s a peek into the tools and technologies that power my development journey. From dynamic front-ends to resilient back-ends, each part of my stack is chosen to deliver fast, flexible, and scalable solutions:

### 🎨 Front-End Mastery
- **Angular**: My go-to framework for building rich, interactive UIs that are both scalable and seamless. Angular helps me bring user interfaces to life with precision and performance.
- **TypeScript**: Adding a layer of safety and structure to my JavaScript code, TypeScript is like my safety net, ensuring cleaner, more reliable code with every line.
- **JavaScript**: The backbone of web development, essential for making user interfaces dynamic and responsive. JavaScript keeps my apps feeling fresh and interactive.

### 🚀 Back-End Power
- **.NET Core**: A robust and reliable back-end framework that allows me to build efficient, high-performing APIs and services. .NET Core is all about smooth, stable, and scalable server-side solutions.
- **C#**: The language that powers my back-end logic, integrating seamlessly with .NET Core for a high-performance back end that meets complex demands.
- **MongoDB**: My choice for flexible, NoSQL data handling. MongoDB is built to scale, making it ideal for modern applications with growing data needs.

With this tech stack, I’m equipped to build end-to-end solutions that are responsive, resilient, and ready to scale. From crafting engaging user interfaces to powering efficient data handling on the back end, every tool in my stack is here to create digital experiences that make an impact.
